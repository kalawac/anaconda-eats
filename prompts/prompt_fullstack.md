## Tips & Tricks
- Explain the approach you are intending to take and be sure to document any assumptions you made. 
- Be sure to tell us what your priorities are when it comes to application so we know what you focused on and where you'd improve given more time.
- Please reach out to your interviewer with any clarifying questions before getting started.
- Documentation is essential! Tell or show us how your API should be used.
- Feel free to use any language and/or framework you are comfortable with.
- You don't need to set up a database, you can use a simple list or json file. Do feel free to hook up your API to a database if you have extra time, though!
- Testing is important! Tell or show us how you would test your API once it is complete.
